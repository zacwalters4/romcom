# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a website that will generate a random romance cover, allow the user to generate their own cover with user input, will allow the user to save covers, and will allow the user to view saved covers.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They have to clone our repo, open it in a text editor, and type in a terminal 'open index.html'.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
We are really proud of the Saved Covers page because it took a lot of work to get functional.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We received the project on Tuesday, started it on Wednesday, and got into Iteration 3 on Saturday. We are going into week 3 of Turing.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Write clean, DRY JavaScript
Explore the connections between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Write code collaboratively

We worked entirely in JS.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We had challenges with showing and hiding the user input form but we were able to get that functionality to work.
We had another challenge in getting the saved poster array to display on the page. We were able to update the data model but we had trouble getting the DOM to update as well. It was very rewarding when we finally got them both to update and we included a screenshot above.
